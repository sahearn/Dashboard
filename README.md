# Dashboard
Fast and lightweight family dashboard, including calendars, weather, and news

## Background
We have a family laptop that sits in the kitchen - when it's not in use I wanted a fullscreen browser window up showing a dashboard with info for all of us.  This would include family Google calendars, current weather and simple forecast, and other info like news and maybe random quotes.

Here were the problems:
- Since this is a personal project, I didn't have the time or interest in learning some big app framework
- I wanted this to be fast and very lightweight: so no stuff like JQuery, object caching, or databases, even if that would make some features easier.  Maybe I'll revisit those someday.
- Nothing out there looked or did exactly what I wanted, or had features I was able to use with my hosting provider

## What You'll Need
- a web host
- PHP
- a sense of humor as you make sense of my code

# My Approach
So the quick and dirty.  This is all homegrown PHP (at the time using PHP 7.2.30) and validated HTML5.

... in progress...
